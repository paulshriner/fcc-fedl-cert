These are the projects I did in the completion of this certificate.

* Random Quote Machine

      Displays quotes from an API and allows sharing via Twitter.

* Markdown Previewer

      Displays Markdown text in a preview pane.

* Drum Machine

      Play a selection of drum samples.

* JavaScript Calculator

      A basic 4-function calculator.

* 25 + 5 Clock

      A countdown timer that cycles between a "Session" and a "Break".

[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc30aca8b2-d2c4-4009-a397-2e6d1ecbde3b/front-end-development-libraries) is my certificate on freeCodeCamp.

**Note:** The projects were submitted on freeCodeCamp through CodePen. The submission links can be found on the certificate page. The projects on this GitHub and on the CodePen submissions are different as CodePen is not using vite (what this repo uses), but the code that I wrote is the same.

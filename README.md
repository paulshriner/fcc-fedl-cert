## Skills
- Bootstrap CSS
- jQuery
- React.js

## Development Tools

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Development environment
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool for setting up the project structure
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)/[GitHub](https://github.com/) - Version control

## Running the Projects

Demos for the projects are accessible from the certificate link. At the bottom of the page, click on "View" to go to the CodePen link for the respective project. The projects on this GitHub and on the CodePen submissions are different as CodePen is not using vite (what this repo uses), but the code that I wrote is the same.

It is also possible to clone the repo to run the projects locally. You will need node.js installed. To run a project, navigate to the project folder, open a terminal window, then type ```npm install```, then ```npm run dev```. This will start a local server that can be viewed in a web browser.
